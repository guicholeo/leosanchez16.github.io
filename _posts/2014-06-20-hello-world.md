This is my first post on leosanchez16.com, and hopefully the first of many. I also have a website that I rarely use to publish news, tutorials for iPhone, and its called [iPhonelokura.com][1] and it is in Spanish. 

Setting up this website took me a while because I'm completely new to [GitHub][3] and to Jekyll. The good thing is that I'm already set up.

I will be using this website as a blog to publish any projects that I do while I'm in school or in my free time. For right now I only have one project that I just pushed to GitHub and also my first one. About that project will be on the next post. 

Meanwhile, you can follow me on [Twitter][2], or [GitHub][3].
